Conclusion\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nThis post will be looking at an interactive data visualisation created to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected South-east Asia countries between 2010-2020 and to identify possible areas of improvement. A screenshot of the original visualisation is shown below. The original visualisation can be found at here. The data was sourced from the The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and the data used was the data set from January 2010 to October 2020 for South East Asia.\r\nOriginal VisualisationWe will also come up with a proposed design and implement it in tableau. Next, a step-by-step guide will be provided for coming up with the proposed design. Finally, we will list down major observations that we are able to derive from the proposed design.\r\n2. Task\r\nThe tasks can be summarised as follows:\r\nCritic the existing visualisation\r\nSketch a proposed design\r\nImplement the proposed design\r\nProvide steps for replication of the proposed design\r\nMajor observations derived from the proposed design\r\n2.1 Critic\r\n\r\nCritic the interactive data visualisation from its clarity, aesthetics and interactivity. At least two from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of clarity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThere is no lead in paragraph for the visualisations, making it hard to determine what message is being conveyed to the viewer.\r\nThe visualisation of the map on the left does not really allow for spatiotemporal visualisation. The map comprises of all events across the years 2015 to 2020, and does not allow the user to visualise over the temporal plane. Further, the graphs on the rights show the breakdown of the events by year, but there is no easy way for the user to visualise that on the map, leading to a disjoint.\r\nThe title of the visualisation states that the visualisation was from 2015-2020. The axis labels of the graphs on the right similarly shows that the data is from 2015 to 2020. However, upon further examination of the visualisation by expanding the date axis from yearly to monthly, we can see that the data is only up till October 2020, rather than till the end of 2020. This may not be clear to the viewers who would expect that every year represents the full 12 months. It also makes it difficult to make comparisons between the difference years.\r\nThe data is only up to October 2020\r\nThe line graphs on the right are difficult to compare because they are on separate graphs. Further, the axes for the different events were of different scale and range, further exacerbating the problem of comparing across different event types.\r\nInconsistent Axes\r\nThe point marks on the map are difficult to visualise due to cluttering once there are too many points in the same area.\r\nCluttered Points\r\nThe colour of the line graphs on the right are not consistent with the legend; the legends uses different colours for different event types, but the line graphs are all of the same colour.\r\nThe source of the data was not provided and therefore the viewer may not know where the data was sourced from.\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe axis label of the graphs on the right could be improved. It is written as “Count of Sheet1”, but the user does not know what “Sheet1” refers to.\r\nThe axis label of the graphs on the right is vertically aligned and is difficult to read.\r\nIn terms of interactivity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe visualisation loads with only Myanmar selected. It would make more sense if the visualisation defaulted to “All” countries, and thereafter allow the user to select by country if desired.\r\nThe interactivity of the visualisation could be improved by allowing users to select the year to display, rather than displaying all the events from 2015 to 2020.\r\nThe visualisation defaults to Myanmar and the dates are fixed from 2015 to 2020\r\nThe tooltips of the points on the map does not provide additional meaningful information. It shows the event ID which is difficult to decipher, the event type which can be inferred from the colour of the point, and the latitude and longitude which can similarly be inferred from where the point is.\r\nInformation provided by tooltip not meaningful\r\nThere is no interactivity between the map visualisation on the left and the line graphs on the right. It could be improved by allowing users to select subsets on the line graph to display where these events took place on the map on the left.\r\n2.2 Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative data visualisation and interactive techniques to improve the current design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sketch of the proposed design:\r\nSketch of Proposed DesignThe proposed design comprises of a map visualisation on the left and line graphs on the right. To the right there will be filters for the user to filter the views by as well as the legends.\r\nThe map visualisation on the left includes a dropdown selection at the top which will allow users to toggle between an all view, a density view and a point plot view. The density view shows the density of the number of events on the map broken down by the different event types in a trellis view. Similarly, the point plot view will show individual events on the plot broken down by the different event types in a trellis view. Further, the points are sized by the number of fatalities. The all view will show both the density view and point plot view. The arrangement of the maps in a 3 x 2 trellis allows for easier comparison across the different events. When the user hovers over a point on the map, a tooltip will display which will show further information of the individual events.\r\nThe line graphs on the right shows the number of events, number of fatalities, and number of fatalities per event broken down by the various event types and across the different years. The lines are also coloured by the different countries to allow users to compare across the different countries.\r\nThe filters on the right allows the user to filter the data across different columns like country. Further, actions between the various visualisations allow the user to select items on one graph that will change the view for the other graphs.\r\n2.3 Proposed Data Visualisation\r\n\r\nUsing Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nThe following is the proposed design for the data visualisation:\r\nProposed Data VisualisationThe proposed data visualisation has been uploaded to Tableau Public and can be found here.\r\nThe proposed design improves on the original visualisation in the following ways:\r\nThere is a density plot to aggregate events to allow users to visualise where there are more events or fatalities. This improves on the original plot which had cluttered points that overlapped each other.\r\nThere are filters for the user, allowing them to filter the view by event type, country and date. These filters are also applied consistently across all visualisations.\r\nThe trellis view allows the user to view the different event types on different maps, rather than cluttering everything into one map.\r\nThere are controls for the user to fine tune how they view the visualisation.\r\nThe tooltips for the visualisations are more informative.\r\n2.4 Step-by-step Description\r\n\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n2.4.1 Data Loading\r\nThe data used for the visualisations was gotten from the The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. We used the dataset for South East Asia with events from Jan 2010 to Oct 2020.\r\nFirst, we load the dataset in Excel format into Tableau by dragging it into Tableau. The important columns we need have been recognised as the correct data type. For example, Event Date is recognised as a date time column, Country is recognised with the geographic role of country, and Latitude and Longitude have been recognised correctly as well. Although Admin1, Admin2 and Admin3 are columns with location information, they have been recognised as string. However, we do not change their roles as they will not be used for this visualisation.\r\n2.4.2 Creating Parameters\r\nIn this section, we detail the steps to create parameters that will be used to allow interactivity for our visualisation.\r\nWe first create a “Map View” parameter that will be used to control which map to show on the map view. The data type is changed to String and allowable values is changed to List. We allow the values All, Density and Point for the various views.\r\nMap View ParameterNext, we a create a View Parameter. This parameter will be used to control whether to show the map, the graph, or both. The settings for this parameter is as follows:\r\nView ParameterNext, we create a “Density Field” parameter that will be used to control how density on the map is displayed, either by the number of events or the number of fatalities.\r\nDensity Field ParameterNext, we create a parameter \"Point Size (Fatalities) to allow the user to control the size of the points on the plot. The points will be sized by the number of fatalities for that event and will default to 1X size. However, the user can choose to change the size to 0.5x or 2x, or to not size it by fatalities at all. A new float parameter will be created as follows:\r\nPoint Size Parameter to control the size of pointsLast, we create a parameter to control how to breakdown the line graphs. This parameter will allow the user to breakdown by Country (default), Sub Event Type, or not break down at all. The following settings are used for this parameter:\r\nLine Graph Breakdown Parameter2.4.3 Creating Density Map\r\nWe rename the default created Sheet1 to Map-Density. This sheet will be used to create the density view of the map.\r\nIn order to get the trellis view for the density plots, we create two calculated fields for Column and Row to get the column and row values based on the event types. For example, the first event type will be Column 0 Row 0, and the second event type will be Column 1 Row 0, and so on so fort. The formula for the calculated fields are as follows:\r\nCalculated Field for ColumnCalculated Field for RowBoth the Row and Column fields are changed to dimensions by right-clicking on it and converting it to a dimension:\r\nConvert Row and Column fields to dimensionsNext, we create a DensityColour field that controls how the density plot is coloured by, i.e. by the number of events or the number of fatalities. The following is the formula for this field:\r\nCalculated Field to control Density Plot ColourNext, we add the fields to the column and row shelves by dragging them from the left pane. We add the Column and Longitude fields to the column shelf and the Row and Latitude fields to the row shelf:\r\nAdding Fields to the Column and Row shelvesAs we want the longitude and latitude to be counted as individual data points rather than aggregated to an average, we change them to dimensions instead:\r\nChange Longitude and Latitude to DimensionsNext, we change the mark type to density to get a density plot on the map:\r\nChange Mark Type to DensityNext, we change the settings for the colour scheme of density, increase the intensity, and decrease the opacity:\r\nChange Density Colour SettingsAs we do not need the column and row axis labels, we hide them by right-clicking on the values and unticking “Show Header”:\r\nHiding Axis LabelsNext, we add our previously created DensityColour field to the colour icon of the marks. This will allow us to control how the density is coloured through the parameter we created earlier:\r\nColour by DensityColour fieldWe add the Density Field parameter to the right of our visualisation to ensure we can control how the density of the plot is calculated. Toggling between both settings will change how the density is visualised on the map.\r\nShow Density Field ParameterNext, we want to add a filter for Event Date to allow users to choose the date range they would like to visualise. We drag Event Date to the Filters shelf and use Range of Dates with the default settings for the user to filter by. We also right click on the Event Date filter in the filters shelf to “Show Filter” so that it is added to the right of the visualisation.\r\nFilter by Event DateNext, we add the filters for Country and Event Type by right-clicking on the field on the left pane and clicking show filter. We change the filter type of Country to Multiple Values (dropdown) and Event Type to Single Values (dropdown).\r\nShow Filter for Country and Event TypeSetting the Country FilterSetting the Event Type FilterNext, we want to add the label for the event type to the individual maps to allow the user to know which event type each map represented. This proved more challenging due to some limitations of Tableau and the way we set up the Trellis Map. In the end, we used the label mark function to achieve it somewhat. We first drag the Event Type to the Label icon.\r\nDrag Event Type to Label IconNext, we change the label settings by clicking on the label icon. The following settings were used:\r\nSettings for LabelNext, we want to add the parameter that controls which map to show. Even though we have not done up the other map, we can still test it for the current worksheet to ensure it works. First, we right-click the “Map View” parameter and click on “Show Parameter” to add it to the right of the visualisation:\r\nAdding Map View ParameterChanging the selection on the dropdown list does not change anything at the moment. Therefore, we need to set up a filter to ensure the sheet is shown or hidden correctly. We first create a new calculated field called “Map Display”. This calculated field is required as we are not able to filter by parameters. Therefore, the calculated field will just take the value of the “Map View” parameter:\r\nCalculated Field for Map DisplayWe then drag this new field to the Filters shelf. We want this sheet to be shown when map view is set to either “All” or “Density”. As such, our settings for the filter will be as follows:\r\nFilter Settings for Map DisplayToggling between the settings will show or hide the map accordingly. However, the title will of the sheet will remain there throughout. As such, we need to use a small hack to show the “title” together with the map. First, we hide the current worksheet title by right-clicking on it and clicking “Hide Title”:\r\nHide titleTo add the title, we created a new calculated field called “Density Title” with the following formula:\r\nDensity Title FieldWe drag this new field to the Columns shelf:\r\nAdd Density Title Field to ColumnThe new “title” is now shown at the top of the map. We right-click on the field label at the top to hide it so that only the “title” is shown:\r\nHide Field LabelNext, we add fields that will be used for our tooltip by dragging them over to the tooltip icon. We add the count, fatalities, event type, sub event type, country fields to the tooltip. We then use the fields in the tooltip:\r\nAdding fields to tooltipSetting the tooltipOur final visualisation for this plot is as follows:\r\nDensity Plot2.4.4 Creating Point Plot Map\r\nIn order to create the point plot map, we duplicate the Map-Density sheet and rename it as Map-Points. We first change the mark type from Density to Circle:\r\nChange Mark to CircleWe want to show every individual event as a circle on the map. Hence, we drag “Event Id Cnty” to the detail icon:\r\nEvent Id Cnty field to Detail IconAfter adding Event Id Cnty to detail, our trellis consisted of one map per event. This was due to how the density title computed the min and max date. We created a new Point Title field and replaced the title with this newly created field.\r\nNew Field for Point TitleReplace the existing title with the new fieldWe want to shape the circles by the number of fatalities. We had previously created a parameter to control the size of the circles. We create a new calculated field which uses the sum of fatalities multiplied by the value of the parameter:\r\nCalculated Field for Fatalities SizeThis field was then dragged to the size icon to determine the size of each circle:\r\nSizing by the Fatalities Size fieldNext, we want to colour the circles based on how we will colour the line graphs later. This is determined by the line graph breakdown parameter. We create a new calculated field for this:\r\nBreakdown FieldWe drag this new field to replace Density Colour on the marks shelf:\r\nColour by Breakdown FieldWe add the Notes field to the tooltip icon and change the tooltip to as follows:\r\nTooltip for visualisationThe final visualisation for this sheet is as follows:\r\nFinal Point Plot2.4.5 Creating the Line Graphs\r\nNext, we create a new sheet called LineGraphs to contain the line graphs. First, we create calculated fields for the number of events and the fatalities per event:\r\nNumber of Events fieldFatalities Per Event fieldWe drag the number of events, fatalities, and fatalities per event fields to the Rows shelf, and the Event Type and Event Date to the Columns shelf:\r\nAdd fields to Rows shelfAdd fields to Columns shelfWe change the Event Date type from discrete to continuous:\r\nChange Event Date type to continuousSimilar to our point plot, we want to breakdown the graph and colour it by our breakdown field. We do this by dragging the breakdown field to the colour icon:\r\nColour by Breakdown FieldIn order to create dynamic tooltips, we create a new sheet called “Line-Tooltip” to create a tooltip visualisation. We create two new calculated fields to determine the breakdown for country and breakdown for sub event type. These calculated fields will be used opposite to the breakdown type the user has selected. For example, if the user has selected to breakdown by country, the breakdown-country field will be empty:\r\nBreakdown Country FieldBreakdown Sub EventWe add the “Measure Names” and “Measure Values” fields to the Columns shelf and the “Breakdown Country” and “Breakdown SubEvent” fields to the Rows shelf:\r\nAdd the fields to the columns and rows shelvesAs we only need the Number of Events, Fatalities and Fatalities Per Event, we drag the rest of the measure values and drop it outside to remove them, retaining only those we need:\r\nRemove unneeded measure values and retain those highlightedNext, we colour the graphs by the breakdown-country and breakdown-subevent fields:\r\nColour by Breakdown-Country and Breakdown-SubeventWe add the measure values to the labels:\r\nAdd measure values to labelWe remove the axis header as it is no longer needed by right-clicking on it and unticking “Show Header”:\r\nRemove Axis HeaderNext, we go back to the LineGraphs sheet to and change the tooltip to as follows to include the new sheet we just setup:\r\nAdd tooltip to visualisation2.4.6 Putting it all together into a dashboard\r\nNext, we create a new dashboard called “Dashboard”. We first add the LineGraphs sheet to the dashboard:\r\nAdd Line GraphsNext, we add a vertical container to the left of the line graphs:\r\nAdd Vertical ContainerWe add the density map to the newly created vertical container:\r\nAdd Density MapNext, we add the point plot below the density map:\r\nAdd Point Map below Density PlotWe hide the title of the graphs by right-clicking on it and hiding the title:\r\nHide TitleWe make sure that all the filters are applied across all visualisations by changing their settings:\r\nChange Settings for FiltersNext, we make sure that any selections on any visualisation will change the selection for other visualisations as well. This can be achieved by a Filter Action as follows:\r\nSelection FilterNext, we rearranged the various parameters and filters, and added a title, source and notes to the bottom.\r\nAdded title, source and notesThe final dashboard is as follows:\r\nFinal Dashboard2.5 Major Observations\r\n\r\nDescribe five major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed data visualisations, we can observe the following:\r\nThe number of protests in South East Asia has been steadily increasing, from 424 in 2010 to 2,224 for the 1st 10 months of 2020. Thankfully, the protests did not result in many fatalities.\r\nProtests have been increasing\r\nPhilippines contributed to the highest number of events and fatalities across all countries, years and event types in the violence against civilians event type in 2016. She had a total of\r\n2016 was a devastating year for PhilippinesBreakdown for Philippines in 2016\r\nThere were many deadly events in both Myanmar and Philippines as evident in the density plot and point plot. While both ranked high in fatalities, Myanmar had more deadly events as can be seen by the size of the circles in the point plot.\r\nDeadly events in Myanmar and Philippines\r\nThe number of fatalities resulting from armed clashes and violence against civilians were much higher than the other event types. This is to be expected for armed clashes, but is a worry trend for violence against civilians as civilians are usually less armed than the other actors such as military. We can see that Myanmar and Philippines had the most events of violence against civilians, but Myanmar had the higher fatalities per such event.\r\nHigh number of fatalities in armed clashes and violence against civiliansMyanmar and Phillipines had high number of violence against civilians\r\nMyanmar, Thailand and Philippines were the countries with the hotspots for battles, explosions or remote violence, protests, and violence against civilians.\r\nMyanmar, Thailand and Philippines hotspots\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nIn this post, we look at how to present conflict data for South East Asia. We identify areas of improvement in terms of clarity, aesthetics and interactivity for the existing visualisation and propose changes to improve the visualisation. We implemented the changes in Tableau and were able to arrive at more insights than the original visualisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Background\r\nThe LinkedIn and World Bank Group have partnered and released data from 2015 to 2019 that focuses on 100+ countries with at least 100,000 LinkedIn members each, distributed across 148 industries and 50,000 skill categories. This data aims to help government and researchers understand rapidly evolving labor markets with detailed and dynamic data (The World Bank Group, 2021).\r\nSimple data visualisations are also publicly available at https://linkedindata.worldbank.org/data. However, they are limited in the exploration of trends because they only allow one parameter of choice.\r\n2. Project Motivation\r\nThrough our project, we want to provide individuals and countries with insights into various interest areas to benchmark themselves against the global landscape. As an extension, we will be including macroeconomic indicators of GDP growth from World Bank Organization to our data visualisations. We envision our project to help answer the following questions:\r\nFor individuals:\r\nIncreasing employability - What are the highly sought-after skills to build up to increase employability in a particular country or a particular sector?\r\nEmployment opportunities - Which country holds better employment opportunities for certain skills or certain industry?\r\nMigration Trends - Which country are people e.g. fellow countrymen, migrating to?\r\nFor countries:\r\nMigration Trends - Where are our (country’s) talent migrating to?\r\nSkill Trends - What are the skills lost or gained in our country or in the sectors in our country?\r\nLearning from other countries - Which skills (i.e. top skill needs in each industry) do we encourage and train in our own people to increase the competitiveness of our labour market against other countries?\r\nSkill and Industry Trends - Are we losing or gaining the skills or industries we desire and according to plan? How do we change this, if required? \r\nOur final deliverable is to create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that allows individuals and countries view their competitive advantage and understand evolving labour markets across the world in four areas: skills, occupations, migration and industries. Comparison will be allowed at both the country-level and industry-level.\r\n3. Limitations of our Project\r\nWe have identified two main limitations of our project which arise due to the LinkedIn dataset:\r\nOur data does not capture all the countries due to the penetration rate of LinkedIn; some countries do not use LinkedIn.\r\nOur data is not representative of the entire migration landscape as LinkedIn data has better coverage fo white-collar workers in knowledge-intensive sectors.\r\n4. Data Description\r\nOur proposed datasets for analyses will come mainly from the LinkedIn-World Bank partnership. We will complement it with other macroeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita from World Bank as well:\r\nhttps://linkedindata.worldbank.org/\r\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\r\nThe LinkedIn-World Bank dataset comprises the following:\r\nIndustry Employment Growth: Growth rate of employment in each industry in each country from 2015-2019\r\n78 distinct industries\r\n\r\nTalent Migration: Growth in number of people with each skill in each country from 2015-2019\r\nIndustry Skills Need: Top 10 skills required in each industry from 2015-2019\r\nSkills Penetration: Penetration of each skill in each industry from 2015-2019\r\nThe GDP per capita dataset comprises annual time-series GDP per capita (current USD) for countries.\r\n5. Proposed Visualisations\r\nThe following sections list down some questions that we hope our application will be able to help answer. We propose various visualisation techniques to help the user visualise the information in a user-friendly way.\r\n5.1 What are the desired skills required for each industry in each year?\r\nTop 10 Skills in IndustryDistribution of Skills by Skill CategoriesTop 10 Industries by Skill Groups5.2 Talent Migration: Which countries, industries and skills are gained and lost from 2015-2019?\r\nVisualising Migration by Country, Skill and IndustrySankey Diagram for Visualising MigrationChord Diagram for Visualising Migration5.3 Employment Growth vs Industry Migration (or Skill- Top 10 in industry)\r\nEmployment Growth vs Industry Migration5.4 Is there any correlation between industry employment growth and GDP growth?\r\nGDP Growth vs Employment Growth5.5 Which countries are similar to each other in terms of skills or growth?\r\nHierarchical Clustering of Countries6. Project Timeline\r\nThe following is the proposed project timeline:\r\nProject Timeline7. Software Tools & R Packages\r\nOur project will be done as an R Shiny application using RStudio as the IDE. We envision the use of the following packages:\r\nR Shiny – For creating an interactive R Shiny web-based application\r\nTidyverse – The tidyverse collection of apps will provide the foundational packages for our project. Some core uses of this collection will be for plotting (ggplot2), data cleaning and manipulation (dplyr, tidyr).\r\nnetworkD3 - For plotting sankey diagrams\r\ncirclize - For plotting chord diagrams\r\n8.

Task\r\nThe tasks can be summarised as follows:\r\nCritic the existing visualisation\r\nSketch a proposed design\r\nImplement the proposed design\r\nProvide steps for replication of the proposed design\r\nMajor observations derived from the proposed design\r\n2.1 Critic\r\n\r\nCritic the data visualisation from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of clarity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThere is no lead in paragraph for the visualisations, making it hard to determine what message is being conveyed to the viewer.\r\nThe title of the left visualisation is supposedly about whether a country is pro-vaccine. However, it only utilises responses for the question “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” to draw this conclusion. There could be other factors which contribute to how people would respond to the question besides how pro-vaccine they are e.g. the prevalence of COVID-19 in a country, the attitude of the people to COVID-19, the standard of healthcare in a country.\r\nBoth the visualisations represent the results as a percentage of the total records for each country. However, the viewer is not able to tell how many total results there are and may not know how representative the results is of the country. For example, a graph of only 10 results will not be as good a representation of a population compared to a graph of 1000 results.\r\nThe two visualisations are not sorted consistently. The left visualisation is sorted by alphabetical order in terms of country, while the right one is sorted by the % of respondents who strongly agreed. This may be confusing to the viewer who may assume that both are sorted in the same way.\r\nThe left visualisation uses 100% stacked bars, but this may be difficult to compare results of different countries\r\nThe right visualisation only shows the proportion of users who strongly agreed. However, it may make more sense to show both those who scored 1 (strongly agree) and those who scored 2 if we want to convey the message of people who agree.\r\nThe source of the data was not provided and therefore the viewer may not know where the data was sourced from.\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe left visualisation uses a five-colour scheme to colour the different values. However, there is no meaning to the colour scheme, and it would be better to use opposing colours for those that agree and those that disagree.\r\nThere is a typo error in the first visualisation, where pro-vaccine is wrongly spelled as “pro-vacinne”.\r\nThe viewer will not know what the legend title refers to as it is indicated as “Vac1”.\r\nThe formatting of the tick values in the x-axis is not consistent across both visualisations.\r\n2.2 Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. The proposed alternative design should include interactive techniques. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sketch of the proposed design:\r\nSketch of Proposed DesignThe proposed design comprises three visualisations and a panel with controls.\r\nThe visualisation in the top left shows the proportion of survey respondents who agree with a survey question by the various countries. It further includes the 95% and 99% error bars to show viewers the amount of uncertainty based on the number of survey respondents.\r\nThe visualisation in the bottom left shows the further breakdown of the survey results by various metrics such as Age, Gender, Household Size or number of Household Children.\r\nThe visualisation in the top right uses divergent stacked bars to present the survey data for each country.\r\nThe controls will allow the viewer to select the following:\r\nSurvey Question - This allows the user to select various questions related to vaccines for analysis, as opposed to using only one question to make a conclusion.\r\nShow Measures - This allows the user to select what elements to display on the charts, whether to include the actual percentage, the 95% error bars and/or the 99% error bars.\r\nAgree Calculation - This allows the user to choose which survey responses to include when showing the proportion of respondents who agree.\r\nBreakdown By - This allows the user to to further breakdown the results by Age, Gender, Household Size, or Household Children.\r\nSort By - This allows the user to sort either alphabetically by Country name or by the Value.\r\nSort Order - This allows the user to sort in an ascending or descending manner.\r\nThe proposed design improves on the original design on the following areas:\r\nThe controls allow the viewer to choose the survey question and the respective results. This lets the viewer know how people responded, rather than using only a single question to deem how pro-vaccine a country is.\r\nThe inclusion of error bars provides a better visualisation of the uncertainty around the results. For example, certain countries may have less results and thus there is more uncertainty in the results. Without showing this uncertainty, the viewer may assume that the results are representative of the population of the countries.\r\nThe second visualisation lets viewers drilldown into the results by more metrics. This allow further analysis of the data to see if there is difference when broken down. For example, we are able to tell how males and females responded.\r\nThe controls allow the viewer to sort the results in a meaningful way. Sorting by country allows consistent placement to compare across various survey questions, while sorting by value allows comparison on how the different countries responded to the surveys.\r\nDivergent stacked bars allow better comparison of Likert scale data as compared to the original.\r\n2.3 Proposed Data Visualisation\r\n\r\nUsing Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nThe following is the proposed design for the data visualisation:\r\nProposed Data VisualisationThe proposed data visualisation has been uploaded to Tableau Public and can be found here.\r\n2.4 Step-by-step Description\r\n\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n2.4.1 Data preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were gotten from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. There was one data file for each country, and the data files had different times when they were last updated ranging from 5 months ago to few days ago. Only countries with data that was updated recently, i.e. in the last 2 weeks, were used for our visualisation. Israel was excluded as it was only added in February 2021. The final data included the following countries - Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\r\nTableau Prep Builder (TPB) was used to prepare our data file. First, all the files were put into the same folder. Next, one of the files was loaded into TPB. The multiple files option in TPB was used to load all the files together as a wildcard union:\r\nWildcard Union of all the filesAs the date of the files was recognised in the wrong locale, we go to the settings tab to change the date to UK format:\r\nChanging locale to United KingdomEach data file contained around 400 columns of data and each row of data comprised survey responses and survey respondent demographics. Only data with vaccine related questions (e.g. vac_1, vac2_1, vac3) as well as survey respondents’ demographics (e.g. gender, age) were retained. We excluded the other columns of data that were not used. The following columns were retained:\r\nColumns RetainedNext, a “clean” step was added. For cleaning, we first filter responses which were in 2021:\r\nFiltering data by dateNext, we renamed the file paths column as “Country”. We also renamed all the values e.g. australia.csv, singapore.csv to their proper country names e.g. Australia, Singapore by using title case and remove the .csv behind.\r\nRenaming CountryFinally, the prepared data was saved for further use in Tableau:\r\nOutput Data for use in Tableau2.4.2 Load Data\r\nWe first load the data in Tableau by dragging the exported .hyper file into Tableau.\r\nNext, we created groups for the Age, Household Size, and Household Children columns. This allowed us to present the data in an aggregated manner.\r\nGrouping for AgeGrouping for Household SizeGrouping for Household Children2.4.3 Creating Parameters\r\nA new sheet called “Survey Results” was created for the first visualisation. In order to allow interactivity for the visualisations, we create a few parameters.\r\nWe first create a parameter to let the viewer choose the survey question. This parameter will be used to control which survey question the visualisation will show the results for. We change the parameter data type to “String” and choose “List” for allowable values. We type in the various values and their corresponding questions in the list below. The questions to values mappings are gotten from the codebook excel spreadsheet included with the data.\r\nParameter for Survey QuestionWe created a corresponding calculated field to select the appropriate column of our data based on the choice of survey question.\r\nCalculated Field for Survey FieldNext, we create a parameter called “Show”. We change the parameter data type to “String” and choose “List” for allowable values. We type in the various values and their text to display in the list below. This will allow the viewer to select which elements to show for the visualisations, i.e. whether to show the Actual Mean, the 95% error bar, and/or the 99% error bar.\r\nParameter for ShowWe create a parameter called “Breakdown By” to allow the viewer to breakdown the results by various metrics. We change the parameter data type to “String” and choose “List” for allowable values. We type in the various values in the list below.\r\nParameter to Breakdown ByWe create a corresponding calculated field to select the appropriate column based on the viewer’s selection.\r\nCalculated Field for Breakdown FieldWe create a parameter “Agree Calculation” to allow the viewer to choose which survey responses to include when calculating the percentage of respondents who agree, i.e. whether to only use “Strongly Agree” or both “Strongly Agree” and “Agree”. We use the integer data type with values of “1” and “2” as these will be used in our formula to calculate the percentage.\r\nParameter for Agree CalculationLastly, we create two more parameters “Sort By” and “Sort Order” to allow the viewer to control the sorting. For “Sort By”, we use the string data type and allow the viewer to sort by either “Country” or “Value”. For “Sort Order”, we use the integer data type and use “1” for Ascending and “-1” for Descending. This will be used in a subsequent formula to control the sort order.\r\nParameter for Sort ByParameter for Sort OrderFinally, we right click on all the parameters and select “Show Parameter” to show them on the worksheet.\r\nSelect Show Parameter to add them to the worksheetParameters are added to the right of the worksheet2.4.4 Creating Fields for Percentage and Error Bars Visualisation\r\nNext, we create the various fields that will support the visualisation.\r\nWe create a calculated field called “Number of Respondents” and set the value to 1. This field will be used to count the number of respondents.\r\nCalculated Field for Number of RespondentsWe create a field called “Total Respondents”. This field will sum up the total number of respondents, excluding the aggregation at the “Country” level. This field will mainly be used for the title to show the total number of respondents.\r\nCalculated Field for Total RespondentsWe create a field called “Score”. This field will get the score of the data in integer ranging from 1 to 5. Note that the survey responses are “1 - Strongly Agree”, “2”, “3”, “4”, and “5 - Strongly Disagree”. Hence, we take the leftmost character of the response and convert it to integer to get the score.\r\nCalculated Field for ScoreNext, we create a field for the percentage of respondents who agree. This is computed by summing the people who meet the threshold set in the “Agree Calculation” parameter and dividing it by the number of respondents.\r\nCalculated Field for Percentage of Respondents who AgreeNext, we create a field for the overall average, without aggregation at the “Country” level. Similar to total respondents, this will be used for the title as well as the reference line.\r\nOverall Percentage of Respondents who AgreeNext, we create two constant fields for the 95% and 99% z score values of 1.959964 and 2.575829 respectively. These will be used to compute the 95% and 99% error bars.\r\nZ 95% Constant ValueZ 99% Constant ValueNext, we create a field for “Standard Error”. Standard error is computed using the following formula:\r\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{percentage * (1-percentage)}{sample size}}\\]\r\nThis is translated to the following calculated field:\r\nCalculated Field for Standard ErrorNext, we create the fields to get the margins of error for 95% and 99%. These are computed using the standard error multiplied by the respective z scores.\r\nCalculated field for 95% Margin of ErrorCalculated field for 99% Margin of ErrorNext, we created four calculated fields for the upper and lower values of both 95% and 99% confidence intervals.\r\nLower 99% ValueUpper 99% ValueLower 95% ValueUpper 95% ValueNext, we create the fields that will be used to display the elements on the visualisation. The “Show” parameter created earlier is used to control which elements to show. By checking if the parameter contains the various values, we show the relevant elements as appropriate.\r\nCalculated Field for Lower 99% with Show checkCalculated Field for Upper 99% with Show checkCalculated Field for Lower 95% with Show checkCalculated Field for Upper 95% with Show checkFinally, we create a field called “Sort Field” to control how we sort the elements on the graph. This field will use the “Sort Order” and “Sort By” parameters to decide whether to sort ascendingly or descendingly and by Country or by Value.\r\nCalculated Field to Determine Sorting2.4.5 Creating Fields for Divergent Stacked Bars Visualisation of Likert Scale Data\r\nWe next move on to create the fields required for the divergent stacked bars.\r\nWe create a calculated field to count the positive responses. Since our survey responses is on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being strongly agree and 5 being strongly disagree, we count the number of 1 and 2 and half of responses of 3.\r\nCalculated Field for Count PositiveSimilarly, we create a field to count the negative responses. We use -1 and -0.5 respectively for negative and neutral responses so that the bars will be towards to left of 0.\r\nCalculated Field for Count NegativeWe create a field called “Positive Percentages” to get the percentages for positive responses. This uses the positive count as the numerator and the number of respondents for the denominator. We exclude “Score” from the level of detail as we need to get the total number of respondents and not just respondents for each score.\r\nCalculated Field for Positive PercentagesWe similarly create one for the negative responses called “Negative Percentages”.\r\nCalculated Field for Negative Percentages2.4.5 Creating Survey Results Visualisation\r\nWe first add the “% Agree” field to the Columns shelf and the “Country” field to the Rows shelf and change the mark to circle to display the % who agree as a circle on the visualisation.\r\nAdding the fields and changing the markWe adjust the x-axis to be fixed from 0 to 1, with tick marks at intervals of 0.1. We also change the format for the x-axis to be in percentage with no decimal places by right-clicking on the axis and formatting it.\r\nChanging Axis Range from 0 to 1Changing Axis Tick Marks to be in 0.1 intervalsFormatting the AxisChanging to Percentage FormatWe drag “Measure Values” to the Columns shelf. We remove the irrelevant measures from the “Measure Values” shelf, leaving only the Upper/Lower 95%/99% values. We also sort them by dragging the 99% values on top.\r\nDefault Measure Values when we drag to the Row ShelfFinal Measure ValuesWe change the axes to dual axis and synchronise the axes by right-clicking on the second axis and selecting the appropriate option.\r\nChanging to Dual AxisSynchronising the AxisWe change the “Measure Names” from detail to colour.\r\nChanging from Detail to ColourWe click on the “Colour” icon and change the colours of the 99% values to light grey and 95% values to a darker grey.\r\nChanging ColoursWe change the mark type to “Line” and drag “Measure Names” from the left pane to the path icon.\r\nChange marks to LineWe go back to the previous AGG(% Agree) mark and change its colour to blue.\r\nChange Mark to BlueSince the mark for % Agree appears behind the error bars, we right-click on the axis and move the mark to the front.\r\nMove mark to frontWe set the number of format for “% Agree”, “Upper 99%”, “Lower 99%”, “Upper 95%” and “Lower 95%” to percentage by holding “Ctrl” and select them before right-clicking on it on the left pane. We then set the number format to percentage with 0 decimal places.\r\nChanging Number Format for % AgreeChanging to Percentage with 0 decimal placesWe add “% Agree” to the rows shelf by dragging it from the left pane and change it from continuous to discrete. This allows us to display the % on the left axis.\r\nAdd % Agree to RowsChanging % Agree from Continuous to DiscreteSince we are using calculated fields to show or hide the error bars, we want to hide the indicator that shows that there are null values when we do not show the 95 or 99% error bars. We do this by going to “Analysis > Special Values > Hide”.\r\nHide Special ValuesWe also hide the top axis since both axes are synchronised. We do this by right-clicking on the top axis and unticking “Show Header”.\r\nHide the top axisTo implement our custom sort using our two parameters, we sort “Country” in the row shelf by right-clicking on it and choosing sort and using our “Sort Field” to sort it.\r\nChoosing the SortSettings for SortWe add another element to show the Grand Total by going to “Analysis > Totals > Show Column Totals” and also “Column Totals to Top”. This will show us the result for all survey respondents aggregated for all countries.\r\nGrand TotalsNext, we drag the “Overall % Agree” field to the detail icon of the “AGG(% Agree)” mark. This will allow us to get a reference line for the overall percentage of people who agree.\r\nOverall % AgreeWe add the reference line to the axis to show the overall percentage of people who agree. We also change the number format for Overall % Agree to percentage.\r\nOption to add reference lineReference Line optionsNext, we drag the “Total Respondents” field to the detail icon of “All” marks. This will allow us to use the total number of respondents in the title.\r\nAdd Total Respondents to DetailWe add a meaningful title to the visualisation by right-clicking on the title and then “Edit title”. The title will show the current survey question as well as the overall percent of respondents who agree and the total number of respondents.\r\nVisualisation TitleWe drag the “Number of Respondents” field to the tooltip icon of the All marks. This will allow us to use the number of respondents in the tooltips of the visualisation.\r\nAdding Number of Respondents to the tooltipWe add meaningful tooltips for % Agree and the Error Bars by clicking the tooltip option of the respective marks.\r\nTooltip for % AgreeTooltip for Error BarsWe scale the visualisation to “Entire View”.\r\nScale to Entire ViewWe add animation to the visualisation by going to “Format > Animations”. We set the animation to on and the duration to 1 second.\r\nTurning Animations OnFinally, we get the final visualisation for survey results as follows:\r\nVisualisation for Survey Results2.4.6 Creating Visualisation for further breakdown of results\r\nIn order to create another visualisation to breakdown the results, we duplicate the previous worksheet to minimise the number of steps required. We rename the duplicated sheet as “Breakdown of Results”.\r\nDuplicate the first visualisationSince we want to breakdown by another field instead of country, we replace “Country” in the rows shelf with “Breakdown Field” by dragging “Breakdown Field” onto “Country” in the rows shelf.\r\nReplacing Country with Breakdown FieldWe change the reference line to use the total of “% Agree”.\r\nEdit Reference LineReference Line for Breakdown VisualisationSince we no longer need the total respondents for this visualisation, we remove it from the detail.\r\nRemove Total RespondentsWe change the tooltips of % Agree and Error Bars to dynamically display the breakdown by field label:\r\nTooltip for % Agree of Breakdown VisualisationTooltip for Error Bars of Breakdown VisualisationWe add a new Action by going to “Worksheet > Actions”. We add a new filter action such that selecting a country on the first worksheet will drilldown the results in the second sheet.\r\nAdding ActionAction SettingsWe change the title to let the viewer know the field we are breaking down by and the country if selected.\r\nVisualisation TitleThe final visualisation for the breakdown is as follows:\r\nVisualisation for Breakdown of Results2.4.7 Creating Visualisation for Divergent Stacked Bars\r\nWe create a new worksheet titled “Likert Results” for the divergent stacked bars visualisation.\r\nWe first change the number format of “Negative Percentages” and “Positive Percentages” to percentage.\r\nChange Number FormatChange format to percentageNext, we drag “Negative Percentages” and “Positive Percentages” to the Columns shelf and “Country” to the Rows shelf.\r\nAdding Fields to Columns and RowsWe sort Country by the “Sort Field”, similar to what we did for our first visualisation.\r\nSort CountryWe drag “Score” to Colour to colour the bars by their score. As “Score” is recognised as a continous measure, we need to change it to a discrete dimension instead.\r\nAdding Score to ColourChanging Score to a Discrete DimensionNext, we change the Axes to dual axis by right-clicking on the Positive Percentages axis and clicking dual axis. We further synchronise the axes to make them consistent.\r\nChange to Dual AxisSynchronise AxisTableau has automatically added “Measure Names” to colour marks. We remove it as it is not required.\r\nRemove Measure Names from ColourWe change the mark type from “Automatic” to “Bar” since we want to show divergent stacked bars.\r\nChange to Bar typeWe change the colour for the bars to use contrasting colours for agree and disagree.\r\nChange ColoursChange Score ColoursAs the bars are not arranged correctly according to their scores, we have to sort the colours accordingly. We do this by right-clicking on the legend items and clicking sort. We manually arrange the colours to make sure the bars are sorted like how we want it.\r\nSort the BarsSort the Score manuallySince we are using dual axis, we hide the header for the top axis by right-clicking on it and unchecking “Show Header”\r\nHide the top axisWe add the Column Totals to the top by going to the Analysis Menu and clicking the respective options.\r\nAdd Column TotalsWe add the title and colour coding for the viewer to easily identify what each colour means.\r\nVisualisation TitleWe change the axis title to “% of Respondents”.\r\nChange Axis TitleWhile divergent stacked bars are useful for comparison across countries, it might not be that intuitive to compare across the responses for each country. Hence we create another worksheet titled “Likert Tooltip” that will contain the visualisation for the tooltip to allow the viewer to compare across the responses.\r\nFirst, we drag Score to the Columns shelf and “Number of Respondents” to the Rows shelf.\r\nAdd Score and Number of RespondentsSince Score is recognised as a continuous measure, we need to change it to a discrete dimension.\r\nChange Score to Discrete DimensionWe also want to change the number of respondents from an absolute value to a percentage of total. We can use a quick table calculation to achieve this.\r\nChange Number of Respondents to Percent of TotalWe want to colour the bars by the scores and so we drag “Scores” to the colours icon. Similarly, we have to change score to a discrete dimension.\r\nColour Bars by ScoreChange Score to Discrete DimensionWe want to add the % of respondents to the label of the graph. We drag “Number of Respondents” to the Label icon and use a quick table calculation to change it from an absolute value to percentage of total.\r\nLabel using Number of RespondentsChange Number of Respondents to percentage of totalWe want to give meaningful labels to the scores. We right click on “Score” in the Columns shelf and click Edit Aliases. We give the scores meaningful labels.\r\nEdit Score AliasesScore AliasesIn order to put the negative bars to the left and the positive bars to the right, we sort the “Score” in the Columns shelf in a descending order.\r\nSort ScoresSince we are using this worksheet as a tooltip, we hide the y axis and the title. We further scale the graph to fit the “Entire View”. The final tooltip is as follows:\r\nTooltip for Likert ResultsWe add the completed worksheet to the tooltip of the previous visualisation. Note that we have to filter by “Country” so that it will show all responses for the country.\r\nTooltip to include the worksheetThe final product of this visualisation is as follows:\r\nVisualisation for Likert Survey Results2.4.8 Combining it together into a Dashboard\r\nFinally, we create a Dashboard titled “Vaccine Survey Dashboard” to combine the visualisations. The following steps were done to create the dashboard:\r\nDrag all three worksheets to the dashboard area to their respective areas and drag the controls to the bottom right.\r\nDashboard Starting Layout\r\nWe remove “Measure Names” and “Score” legend from the bottom right.\r\nRemove Measure NamesRemove Score from Dashboard\r\nWe resize the areas for the various visualisation for aesthetic purposes.\r\nWe add the source and author information below.\r\nSince the filter action was created earlier, we need to adjust it to work for the dashboard. We adjust the action based on the filters below.\r\nChange the Filter Action\r\nThe final product of the proposed visualisation in the form of a dashboard is as follows:\r\nFinal Dashboard2.5 Major Observations\r\n\r\nDescribe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed data visualisations, we can observe the following:\r\nMore people would like to adopt a “wait and see” approach for getting the vaccine. Comparing the responses for the question on whether they are willing to take the vaccine this week against whether they are willing to take the vaccine a year from now, the percentage of people who agree increased for all countries except for Germany. The overall percentage increased from 52.47% of respondents who were willing to get the vaccine immediately compared to 59.56% one year later.\r\nWillingness to take vaccine this weekWillingness to take one year from now\r\nOlder people were generally more willing to take the vaccine as compared to younger people. This could be due to the fact that they are less worried about potential side effects of the vaccine as compared to younger people. We can see from the image below that about 42% to 44% of younger people in various age groups within the 18 to 45 range wanted to get the vaccine once it was available, compared to 51% and 58% for the age groups 46 to 55 and 56 to 65 respectively. Finally, people aged 66 and above were most willing, as 72% of that age group agreed to it.\r\nOlder people more willing to take vaccine as compared to younger people\r\nFemales were more worried about the potential side effects of a COVID-19 compared to males. This can be seen from the results where the proportion of females in all countries exceeded the proportion of males who agreed that they were worried about the potential side effects. The figure below shows the overall difference, where 54% of females were worried compared to 42% of males.\r\nFemales vs Males worrying about side effects\r\nThe residents of Japan have less believe in their Government to provide them with an effective vaccine. This can be seen by the fact that despite 68% (highest among all countries) of them being worried about getting COVID-19, only 47% (2nd lowest among all countries) believe that their Government will provide them with an effective vaccine and 37% (3rd lowest among all countries) of them were willing to take a vaccine this week. This has also been observed in the following article Survey: Japanese less trusting of government in health crisis, which shows that the Japanese are less trusting of government in a health crisis.\r\n68% of Japanese worried about getting COVID-1947% of Japanese believe their Government will be able to provide them with an effective vaccine37% of Japanese were willing to take a vaccine this week\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nIn this post, we look at how to present vaccine survey data for various countries. We identify areas of improvement in terms of clarity and aesthetics for the chart and propose changes to improve the visualisation. We further added interactive elements to enhance viewers’ experience to analyse the data. We implemented the changes in Tableau and were able to arrive at more insights than the original visualisation.\r\n4. References\r\nWexler, S. (2018, August 20).

Next, a step-by-step guide will be provided for coming up with the proposed design. Finally, we will list down major observations that we are able to derive from the proposed design.\r\nTask\r\nThe tasks can be summarised as follows:\r\nCritic the existing visualisation\r\nSketch a proposed design\r\nImplement the proposed design\r\nProvide steps for replication of the proposed design\r\nMajor observations derived from the proposed design\r\nCritic\r\n\r\nCritic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of clarity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe statement above the graph uses age ranges like 55 & over and 25 to 54. However, the graph itself uses a more granular age range. This may be result in viewers having difficult to relate to the statement.\r\nThe statement above the graph refers to the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), but this data is not captured within the graph. This may be confusing to the viewer as they may think the chart represents LFPR.\r\nThe line chart used may not be the best representation for the data as lines are usually used when dealing with continuous data to indicate changes or trends. Since the data presented is of categorical data, it may make more sense to use an alternative representation like a bar chart.\r\nThe lines that show the Median Age for both June 2009 and June 2019 is an attempt to show the relative position of the median. For example, the line for the median age for June 2009 is 1/4 way between the tick marks of 40-44. However, this may confuse the viewers as the x-axis is not meant to be continuous.\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThere is no y-axis for the graph, making it difficult for the viewer to know the value of the points.\r\nThe table below is a waste of ink as it is visually difficult for a viewer to compare the numbers.\r\nThe chart title is generic and could be changed to something more impactful so the viewer knows what is the message we want to convey.\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sketch of the proposed design:\r\nSketch of Proposed DesignThe proposed design comprises two charts. The chart on the left compare the resident labour force and resident population for the different age groups for 2009 and 2019. The stacked bar chart will show the absolute numbers of the resident labour force and the residents outside of labour force, with the total length of the bar chart giving the resident population. Using stacked bars will alow us to visualise how the resident labour force and total population has changed for 2009 and 2019.\r\nThe chart on the right will provide a 100% breakdown of the various age groups from 2009 to 2019. This will allow us to observe the trend over the years and see if there has been any shift in the composition.\r\nProposed Data Visualisation\r\n\r\nUsing Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nProposed visualisationThe proposed data visualisation has been uploaded to Tableau Public and can be found here.\r\nStep-by-step Description\r\n\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\nData preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were gotten the Ministry of Manpower’s website at https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx. Specifically, Table 5 Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June) and Table 7 Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June) were used for our data visualisation.\r\nScreenshot of Table 5 download from MOM’s websiteThe data file was in Excel format, but had to be cleaned in Excel by removing the extra columns and excess rows. Both the files were then merged into a single csv file, with an additional column indicating the type where LFPR refers to the Labour Force Participation Rate and RLF refers to the Resident Labour Force:\r\nScreenshot of csv fileNext, the data was loaded into Tableau Prep Builder for further preparation.\r\nThe data was first pivoted to convert the individual year columns into a single column:\r\nIndividual year columns were pivoted and the resulting columns were named as Year and ValueNext, the data was unpivoted from the Data and Value columns to get 2 columns for LFPR and RLF:\r\nUnpivot dataA calculated field was created to get the Residents Outside Labour Force (ROLF):\r\n[RLF]/[LFPR]*(100-[LFPR])\r\nThe column on LFPR was no longer required and was deleted.\r\nNext, the table was pivoted on the RLF and ROLF columns and given meaningful names.\r\nPivot RLF and ROLF columnsFinally, the prepared data was saved for further use in Tableau:\r\nOutput data for use in TableauLoad Data\r\nThe prepared data was loaded in Tableau:\r\nData was loaded in TableauThe Age Group column was renamed to Age Group (Original). The renaming was done such that we can group this column to aggregate the data further. This will be elaborated on later.\r\nThe Year column was renamed to Date and a calculated field was calculated to extract the year as a numerical value:\r\nCreation of Year ColumnComparison of 2009 and 2019’s Population and Labour Breakdown\r\nWe first create a new Tableau worksheet to compare the population and labour breakdown of 2009 and 2019. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nDrag the Residents (Thousands) measure to the Column shelf.\r\nDrag the Age Group (Original) dimension to the Row shelf.\r\nWe further aggregate the data by grouping the age groups into 3 groups - 15 - 24, 25 - 55, and 55 & Over.\r\nFurther aggregate the Age Groups\r\nWe add the Year field into the Rows shelf after the Age Group field. Next, we change the year field to a Dimension instead of a Measure, and for it to be a discrete dimension since we only want to compare 2009 and 2019.\r\nWe add the Year field into the filter, make it into a Discrete Dimension, and filter the years 2009 and 2019.\r\nWe drag Age Group to the Colour icon to colour the bar charts by the different age groups.\r\nWe drag Type to the Detail icon, and change Detail to Colour in order to further colour the age groups by the Resident Labour Force (RLF) and the Residents Outside of Labour Force (ROLF).\r\nWe drag Resident (Thousands) to the Label icon to add a Label on the bar charts. We want to display the percentage breakdown of RLF and ROLF and so we use a “Percent of Total” quick table calculation. The calculation was computed using “Table (Across)”.\r\nWe sort according to Age Group (older groups on top) and Year (2019 on top).\r\nWe change the colour of the items, using 3 distinct colours for each age group and lighter and darker shades to differentiate the RLF and ROLF.\r\nLegend Colours\r\nWe resize the chart to make the bars thicker.\r\nWe annotate the chart to provide our insights.\r\nWe provide meaningful titles to the chart and the legend.\r\nThe final product of the worksheet is as follows:\r\nFinal Product of WorksheetComparing Breakdown of Labour Force by Age Group from 2009 to 2019\r\nNext we create a worksheet to compare the breakdown of labour force from 2009 to 2019. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nWe drag the Year field to the Columns shelf and change it to a discrete dimension.\r\nWe drag the Residents (Thousands) measure to the Rows shelf. As we want to show the % breakdown per year, we use a quick table calculation to calculate the % of total, computing it using Table (Down). We use the same column as the label for the bar graphs.\r\nWe drag the Type field to the Filters shelf. As we want to only show the breakdown for the labour force, we filter by RLF type.\r\nWe drag Age Group to the Colours icon to colour the bar charts by age group.\r\nWe sort the stacked bars by Age Group with the youngest being below and oldest on top.\r\nWe change the colours to make them consistent with our previous worksheet.\r\nWe annotate the chart to provide our insights.\r\nWe provide meaningful titles to the chart, y-axis and the legend.\r\nThe final product of the worksheet is as follows:\r\nBreakdown of Resident Labour Force from 2009 to 2019Combining it together into a Dashboard\r\nFinally, we create a Dashboard to combine both charts. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nDrag both worksheets into the dashboard area.\r\nWe add texts the top and bottom of the dashboard for the title, description of the message we want the viewer to take away, and the sources used for the charts.\r\nThe final product of the proposed visualisation in the form of a dashboard is as follows:\r\nFinal Product of Proposed VisualisationMajor Observations\r\n\r\nDescribe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed data visualisation, we can observe the following:\r\nThere are more older residents in the labour force in 2019 compared to 2009, both in terms of percentage and absolute value.\r\nThere are more total older residents, showing that people are living longer.\r\nThe percentage of older residents in the labour force has been increasing over the years, signalling an ageing workforce.\r\nConclusion\r\nIn this post, we look at MOM’s statement and chart describing how the median age of the workforce has shifted from 2009 to 2019. We identify areas of improvement in terms of clarity and aesthetics for the chart and propose changes to improve the visualisation. We implemented the changes in Tableau and were able to arrive at more insights than the original visualisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
